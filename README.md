#CICATRICIEBACI IN SUMMARY

#cicatriciebaci (#SCARKISSES) is a narrative and interactive project that tells stories of human scars; they are past wounds, embroidered into our life, experiences that have shaped and empowered us. In sharing your scars and stories with me, the narrator, we embark on a visual journey of self-discovery and create a new story we can share with the world. Those stories unfold together, while evoking emotions very personal to each storyteller. 

We all have scars. They often remain voiceless and without recognition.

I believe we are everyday heroes, and we should be recognized as such.

Every scar deserves a crown!
 
This path of narrating and feeling narrated is a gift, and is a tool for creating awareness. An awareness that will be carried out with respect and discretion.
We hope to stimulate your thoughts and words, for make you willing to play this alchemical act with us by donate your story to this noble cause.

The photocollages I create are portrait of your scars, or better sayd, portraits of healing processes, I want to
bring awareness by sharing people achievement throgh art.
